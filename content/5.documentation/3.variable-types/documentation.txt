Variable Types      {#intro}
==============

There are three type of variables within stacey’s templating system:

<strong><a href="./variables/"><em>@</em>variables</strong></a>
:   constructed from the contents of the page’s .txt file and supplemented by stacey (ie. _&#64;page_name_).

<strong><a href="./collections/"><em>$</em>collections</a></strong>
:   collections of assets or pages that can be looped over (ie. _$children_).

<strong><a href="./partials/"><em>:</em>partials</strong></a>
:   shorthand reference to include files from within the _/templates/partials_ directory (ie. _&#58;navigation_).
