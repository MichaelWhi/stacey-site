Overview      {#intro}
========

Stacey is a framework for building simple dynamic html websites.

The project is based around two core ideals:

1.  Separating textual content & assets from your html templates, and
2.  Removing the ugliness of php logic from your presentational markup.

These two ideals map directly to the <em>/content</em> and <em>/templates</em> folders respectively.

Stacey handles all the dynamic parts like creating breadcrumbs, navigation lists & Atom feeds and including images, videos & assets.
It includes a simple [templating language] and [partial system] so you have complete control over every piece of markup that is generated.

There are a [few simple portfolio-style templates] provided to give an idea of how the system works, but don’t let that mislead you, stacey is flexible enough to build sites of significant complexity.

### Deployment

Because stacey uses the file system to store and manage data, it means you are able to build & deploy sites extremely quickly. Additionally, as php hosting is so common, stacey-based sites can be deployed very cost-effectively and to pretty much any standard hosting package.


### Caching     {#caching}

Because reading a file system can become slow on larger sites, stacey uses a combination of file-based caching & e-tag headers to ensure pages are always loaded as quickly as possible. The caching system is smart enough to only rebuild the cache when the content has been updated.


### 600 lines      {#lightweight}

The entire stacey codebase is around 600 lines of code, so it shouldn’t be too hard to read through, get an idea of how it works & extend for your own purposes.

The project is maintained over at _<http://github.com/kolber/stacey>_, so feel free to pick through the code, suggest improvements or fork it and fix things yourself.
