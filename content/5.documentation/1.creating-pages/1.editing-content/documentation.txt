Content Editing           {#content-editing}
===============

Within the _/content_ directory, there is a file named _\_shared.txt_.

If you open it up with a text editor, you should see:
<pre>
name: <em>Name</em>
&#45;
profession: <em>Graphic Designer</em>
&#45;
email: <em>hi@yourdomain.com</em>
</pre>

Replace the highlighted data with your own details.

### Text file encoding    {#text-file-encoding}

All of your .txt files should be encoded using UTF-8. In addition to ensuring no strange characters are inserted which could break stacey’s rendering engine, this will also allow you to use special characters such as _&ouml;_, _&mdash;_ or double-byte characters such as _照_ or _ラ_.

Any decent text editor will give you the options to edit and save your text files as UTF-8, so google should be able to provide answers on how to do this with your editor of choice.

You can read more about [text files][] & [UTF-8 encoding][] on Wikipedia.



### Editing content       {#editing-content}
Each folder which is to be displayed as a page should have a _.txt_ file inside it (even if this text file is empty). The name of the .txt file should match up with a file in the _/templates_ folder, as this is how you select which template to use for each page.

### How variables are created:  {#how-variables-are-created}
<ol>
	<li>Browser hits <em>http://yourdomain.com/about/</em>.</li>
	<li>
		<p>Stacey reads the appropriate content file <em>/content/3.about/content.txt</em>.</p>
<pre>
title: About Title
&#45;
content: Lorem ipsum.
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Two variables are extracted from the keys & values from within the .txt file: <em>&#64;title</em> & <em>&#64;content</em>. These will be available for use within the templates.</li>
	<li>Stacey finds the matching template file, in this case, <em>/templates/content.html</em></li>
	<li>
		<p>Stacey replaces the variables in the template and outputs the final html.</p>
		<p>So this template code:</p>
<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;main&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;<em>&#64;title</em>&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;<em>&#64;content</em>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
	<p>becomes this html:</p>
<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;main&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;<em>About Title</em>&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;<em>Lorem ipsum.</em>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
	</li>
</ol>

### Content file format      {#content-file-format}

The content files all follow a standard format; each _key_ is followed by a _:_, a _value_ and a hyphen (&#45;) to close the value. 
<pre>
<em>key</em>: <em>value 
&#45;</em>
</pre>

The keys match up with variable markers in the template files which get replaced with the contents of the _value_. You can create as many of your own keys as you need.

#### Keys {#keys}

A key may only contain the following characters:  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
0123456789
_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Essentially, lowercase latin alphanumeric characters and underscores.  
Or, for the more technically inclined, anything which can be matched by the following regular expression: _`/[a-z0-9_]+?:/`_

A standard content file looks something like this:
<pre>
title: The Test Project 1
&#45;
date: 2009, Jun—
&#45;
content: 
Lorem ipsum dolor...

</pre>

#### Separating Keys/values {#separating-keys-values}

Each value should be followed by a blank line containing only a hyphen character. The hyphen is optional on the last key/value pair.

<pre>
title: 	The Test Project 1
<em>&#45;</em>
date: ...
</pre>

#### Values {#values}

If you want one of the values to be empty, leave a space after the colon.

<pre>
title:<em> </em>
&#45;
date: ...
</pre>

Any values which contain a newline character will be parsed as markdown.
Which means within the following example, <em>&#64;title</em> will come through as plain text, while <em>&#64;content</em> will be parsed as markdown.  
This:

<pre>
date: 2009, Jun—
&#45;
content:
Lorem ipsum.
</pre>

will become:

<pre>
&#64;date =&gt; 2009, Jun—

&#64;content =&gt; <em>&lt;p&gt;</em>Lorem ipsum.<em>&lt;/p&gt;</em>
</pre>

### Markdown      {#markdown}
