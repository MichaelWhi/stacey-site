Running on OSX      {#intro}
==============

It is much easier (and quicker) to edit files on your local system than on a server using an ftp program, so it is worth investing the time to get a local copy up and running.

Luckily, Mac OSX 10.5 & higher comes with both PHP & Apache pre-installed.  
To get things running there are a few setup steps to go through:<br><br>

<ol>
	<li markdown="1">[Download stacey][] and unzip the contents of the zip file to your desktop.</li>
	<li markdown="1">
		<p markdown="1">With a Finder window selected, click _Go_&rarr;_Go to Folder..._</p>
		![Go to Folder in OSX](/images/osx/1-finder-go-to.png)
		<p markdown="1">In the dialogue box that is provided, enter _/etc/apache2/_ and press enter.</p>
    ![Go to /etc/apache2/](/images/osx/2-go-to-folder.png)
	</li>
	<li markdown="1">
		<p markdown="1">You will need to change the permissions of the _apache2_ folder & the _httpd.conf_ file inside it to be: _everyone: Read &amp; Write_. You can bring up the permissions on a file or folder by selecting it and pressing _Command-I_.</p>
		<i>You may need to click on the small lock icon in the bottom right hand corner and enter your password before osx will allow you to change these permissions.</i>

	</li>
	<li>
		<p markdown="1">Next we need to enable PHP, so open up _httpd.conf_ in a text editor and find the line that reads:</p>
		<pre>#LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so</pre>
		<p markdown="1">and remove the _#_ so it reads:</p>
		<pre>LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so</pre>
		<p markdown="1">Then we need to enable .htaccess support for the _/Library/WebServer/Documents_ folder, so find the section that reads:</p>
<pre>
&lt;Directory &quot;/Library/WebServer/Documents&quot;&gt;
#
# Possible values for the Options directive are "None", "All",
# or any combination of:
#   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews
#
# Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
# doesn't give it to you.
#
# The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see
# http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#options
# for more information.
#
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews

#
# AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.
# It can be "All", "None", or any combination of the keywords:
#   Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
#
AllowOverride None

#
# Controls who can get stuff from this server.
#
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>
		<p>And change the &lsquo;AllowOverride&rsquo; section to read:</p>
<pre>
&lt;Directory &quot;/Library/WebServer/Documents&quot;&gt;
#
# Possible values for the Options directive are "None", "All",
# or any combination of:
#   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews
#
# Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
# doesn't give it to you.
#
# The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see
# http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#options
# for more information.
#
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews

#
# AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.
# It can be "All", "None", or any combination of the keywords:
#   Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
#
AllowOverride <em>All</em>

#
# Controls who can get stuff from this server.
#
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>
		<p>Then you can save and close the file.</p>
	</li>
	<li markdown="1">
		<p markdown="1">Next you need to open _/Library/WebServer/Documents_ using the Finder, as this is where all of our website files will be stored.</p>
    ![Showing the full path to /Library/WebServer/Documents in Finder](/images/osx/8-finder-documents.png)
		<p>You should delete anything that is already in there and drag in the contents of the stacey folder that you unzipped to your desktop earlier.</p>
		<p markdown="1">Your _Documents_ folder should now look like this:</p>
		![Screenshot of /Library/WebServer/Documents with all the stacey folders inside it](/images/osx/10-finder-stacey-filled.png)
	</li>
	<li markdown="1">
		<p markdown="1">Next, open _Sharing_ within your _System Preferences_ and check the checkbox next to Web Sharing.</p>
		<p><i>If this checkbox is already checked, you will need to uncheck it and then recheck it again (this restarts Apache, so that it will recognise the changes to the httpd.conf file).</i></p>
    ![System Preferences / Sharing screenshot](/images/osx/11-web-sharing-on.png)
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p markdown="1">If you want to enable [clean urls](/tutorials/enable-clean-urls) continue below, otherwise, you can skip this step.</p>
		<p markdown="1">You can&rsquo;t rename your htaccess file to .htaccess using the Finder, so you will need to open up _Terminal_ and type the following two commands:</p>
<pre>
cd /Library/WebServer/Documents
</pre>
    <p markdown="1">Then hit _enter_ and type the following command:</p>
<pre>
cp htaccess .htaccess
</pre>
    <p markdown="1">and hit _enter_ again.<br>
      This will make a copy of your _htaccess_ file and rename it to _.htaccess_</p>
		<p markdown="1"><i>Terminal sits within your _/Applications/Utilities_ folder.</i></p>
	</li>
	<li markdown="1">
		<p markdown="1">Now if you open up a browser and visit _http://localhost/_, you should see your local copy of stacey running.</p>
    ![A screengrab showing stacey running from http://localhost](/images/osx/14-stacey-running.png)
		<p markdown="1">You can edit the files in the _/Library/WebServer/Documents_ folder directly and then view the output at _http://localhost/_.</p>
	<p markdown="1">One thing to keep in mind, once you finish your site and copy it over to your live server, you will need to rename your _htaccess_ file to _.htaccess_ again. Within your ftp program you should be able to rename it as you would any other file. You won't need to use Terminal.</p>
	<p markdown="1">You have already completed the installation step, so you can jump straight into reading about [creating pages][] with stacey.</p>
