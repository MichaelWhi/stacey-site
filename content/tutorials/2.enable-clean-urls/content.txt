Enabling clean urls      {#intro}
===================

To ease the setup process, by default stacey uses query-based urls (which look like _http://yourdomain.com/?/page-name/_). 
If you prefer, you can enable clean urls (ie. _http://yourdomain.com/page-name/_) by following the steps below.

<i>Your server will require support for _.htaccess_ files & [mod_rewrite][] (which is normally enabled by default).
Contact your host if youâ€™re not sure.</i>

1. In your main stacey folder (the one containing the index.php file), rename your _htaccess_ file to _.htaccess_.  
   The end result should look like this:

2. That's it. Clean urls are now enabled.  
   You can test they are working correctly by visiting http://yourdomain.com/projects/
