Installation
=============

<i>If you are running OSX 10.5 or later, you can run stacey locally.  
  See [Running stacey on OSX][].</i>

1.  Log into your server using the FTP details provided by your host.

2.  Copy all the files from the stacey folder into the web directory on your server.  
    Your web directory should now look like this.

5.  Go into the <em>/app</em> folder and change the permissions on the <em>_cache</em> folder to be <em>777</em> (completely public).

6.  Visit your website and you should see stacey running with all its default content:

7. Optionally, at this point you can also enable [clean urls][] by renaming your _htaccess_ file to _.htaccess_

If things arenâ€™t displaying correctly, you can visit the [stacey support forums][] for help. If everything looks like the screenshot above, then you probably want to read about [creating pages][] next.
