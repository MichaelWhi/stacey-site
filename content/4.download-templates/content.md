Templates               {#intro}
=========

Installing templates    {#installation}
--------------------

1.  Download the [latest version of stacey](/download/).

2.  Delete the _/content_, _/public_ & _/templates_ folders.
    
    <i>If your site already contains content, leave the _/content_ folder as is, and donâ€™t overwrite it. You may have to do a little tweaking to get your content to match up with the new template, but it shouldn't be anything drastic.</i>

3.  The zip file should contain three directories named _content_, _public_ & _templates_. Drag them in to replace the ones you just deleted.
